      If she's thrifty and cooks at the hotel, maybe she should go to <strong>{{higherMealRateCity.City}}</strong>, where she'll get to pocket an extra <strong>${{higherMealRateCity.Meals - lowerMealRateCity.Meals}}</strong> for meals than if she went to {{lowerMealRateCity.City}}.

      {{higherMealRateCity.City}} and {{lowerMealRateCity.City}} will get her the same food allowance, so it's <strong>kind of a toss up there.</strong>

    <div class="bg-danger compare-box" ng-show="twoCities.length>1 && higherLodgingRate!=lowerLodgingRate">
      And if she's staying with a friend, maybe she should just go to <strong>{{higherLodgingCity.City}}</strong>, where on average she'll get to pocket an extra <strong>${{higherLodgingRate - lowerLodgingRate | number:2}}</strong> for lodging than if she went to {{lowerLodgingCity.City}}.
